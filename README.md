Learn Adjacency Matrix is a graduate project that intends to teach the _adjacency matrix_ visualisation techniques to students with few or zero background in visualisations.

From the technical perspective, this project uses Typescript and Tailwind, D3.js and HTML Canvas to render the visualizations and UI. The App is managed by a custom UI framework.
